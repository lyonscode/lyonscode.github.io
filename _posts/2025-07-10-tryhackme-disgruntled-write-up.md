> Hey, kid! Good, you’re here!
>
> Not sure if you’ve seen the news, but an employee from the IT department of one of our clients (CyberT) got arrested by the police. The guy was running a successful phishing operation as a side gig.
>
> CyberT wants us to check if this person has done anything malicious to any of their assets. Get set up, grab a cup of coffee, and meet me in the conference room.

Task 1 was introduction, let's move on to Task 2!

## Task 2 - Linux Forensics review



## Task 3 - Nothing suspicious... So far

## Task 4 - Let’s see if you did anything bad

## Task 5 - Bomb has been planted. But when and where?

## Task 6 - Following the fuse

## Task 7 - Conclusion

> Thanks to you, we now have a good idea of what our disgruntled IT person was planning.
>
> We know that he had downloaded a previously prepared script into the machine, which will delete all the files of the installed service if the user has not logged in to this machine in the last 30 days. It’s a textbook example of a  “logic bomb”, that’s for sure.
>
> Look at you, second day on the job, and you’ve already solved 2 cases for me. Tell Sophie I told you to give you a raise.
